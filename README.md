# Busy-Me-Calendar


##Challenges

My first challenge was identifying how to place a text box into my HTML. I chose this route to help me recap my HTML and CSS knowledge and to further my understanding of how to work Javascript alongside them. I conducted research and came across this website: https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html-text-box I found that I could use a variety of tags to input a text box. I settled on using the <textarea> tag as I wanted the user to be able to input a range of text as opposed to just a single line. I then worked on implementing the CSS and styling before replicating the container to produce a calendar.
